# Kaggle-project--Elo-loyalty-score-prediction

### Backgroud information about the project
Elo provides recommendation to each card holder based on his/her historical transaction records, if the card holder visits the new merchant based on the recoomendation, the transaction records are then kept in the new merchant transaction table. By measuring the reply of the recommendations that are given to the customer, Elo then assigned the loyalty score to each customer (Elo doesn't reveal the detail of how the loyalty score is calculated). 

### The objective of the project
Loyalty score prediction: by utilizing the information in different tables to make accurate loyalty score prediction.

### Data set information
The data is contained in 3 types of tables, a/card holders information table (about 200,000 instances) b/transaction history (historical transaction table (18 milion instances) & new merchant transaction table (1 milion instances)) c/marchant level information table (about 300,000 instances)

### The outline of the project
1) Exploratory Analysis-learn feature distributions / relationship between tables
2) Extract feature for model building
3) Model building, evaluation and result
